Organisation file
=================

Definition
----------
The *organisation file* contains the data that relates to the **IATI organisation standard**.

It is an XML file, containing all the relevant fields for the publisher organisation.


Considerations
--------------
An IATI publisher should publish one organisation file.

It should be updated at least annually.

It must be valid XML.

A link to the organisation file should be published on the IATI Registry.  
Ideally, this link would be to an organisation file on the publisher website or open data portal.  However, third party tools are available to generate and host files on behalf of publishers.
