Publishing Expectations
=======================

Definition
----------
When publishing to the **IATI standard** it is expected that an organisation considers their data to be:

* Valid.
* Comprehensive.
* Timely.
* Historic.
* Forward-looking.
* Available openly.


Considerations
--------------

* **Valid** - in publishing to IATI, it is expected that data is formatted correctly.

	* Validity against the **IATI standard** includes basic schema validation, plus usage of relevant code list values.
	* Additionally, the **IATI standard** includes rulesets - that help determine additional constraints on data.

* **Comprehensive** - in publishing to IATI, it is expected that all relevant information is provided.

	* The scale and scope of an IATI publication can be stated within the organisation Implementation Schedule
	* Exclusions and redactions can be made for a variety of reasons

* **Timely** - in publishing to IATI, it is expected that data is the most recent available within the processes set by an organisation.

	* Organisation can choose to update their IATI data on a variety of timescales.
	
* **Historic** - in publishing to IATI, it is expected that data is not lost or replaced over time

	* Organisations build up a historic record of their activities over-time - IATI is not a *snapshot*.
	
* **Forward-looking** - in publishing to IATI, it is expected that organisations make relevant projected values available.

	* Planned budgets for countries, activities or the organisation asa whole, are the most common forward-looking elements
	* Results can also include forward-looking targets.

* **Availabile** - in publishing to IATI, it is expected that organisations ensure their data is accessible and open.

	* IATI does not *host* data - it is the responsibility of publishers to maintain and publish the data
	* Organisations often publish data on their own website, but can also utilise third part websites
