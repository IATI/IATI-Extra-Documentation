Non-Core Codelist Changelog
===============================

Non-core codelists are ‘non-functional’ codelists, that usually provide lookup information on e.g. currencies, languages in use, countries, etc. Often they are derived from third party lists and an addition or modification has a minor impact on the sense and use of the data.

This page details any additions of changes to Non-core codelists. Further information on `how IATI codelists are  managed <http://reference.iatistandard.org/codelists-guides/codelist-management/>`__.

Non-core codelists were previously called non-embedded.
