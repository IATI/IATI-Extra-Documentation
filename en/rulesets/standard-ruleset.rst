Standard Ruleset
================
The Standard Ruleset is a collection of rules that cover most of the requirements of the IATI Standard and that a computer could, in principle, test. Typically, these are rules about the data that cannot be enforced by the schema alone. It covers for example, the ordering of dates, and checks on the format of an iati-identifier.
There are some things given in definitions of elements that really only a human can interpret, such as "Is a title meaningful?". The Standard Ruleset does not even try to deal with cases such as this.
We have created a generic framework that allows us to express many of these rules in a way that both humans and machines can understand.
We call rules in this generic format our "Machine Readable" rules.
We have written some code to interpret these rules, and hope that they will be useful, for example, for someone that wanted to build a web application that tested people's data against these rules. They should be easy to implement.
At the beginning of 2019 the IATI Technical Team updated the ruleset so that the majority of MUST statements in IATI are now included in the Standard Ruleset.

Using the Standard Ruleset
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The current Standard Ruleset is a collection of rules that can be used to test the data in a single ``iati-activity`` or ``iati-organisation`` record.
IATI data is often found as large files containing collections of (for example) activities, so to test a file of IATI data against the Standard Ruleset means running the tests on each ``iati-activity`` or ``iati-organisation`` record in that file.
Every ``iati-activity`` or ``iati-organisation`` record has the option to use different elements of the IATI Standard, and to also repeat certain elements, so in defining a Standard Ruleset it is necessary to include rules that may or may not need to apply for each individual ``iati-activity`` or ``iati-organisation`` record.
If we take a ``transaction`` from an ``iati-activity`` record as an example, we can see that this element does not have to be reported. However, it may also be reported many times. There are rules in the Standard Ruleset to check that some of the data reported in transactions makes sense, so these tests could either be run many times, or not at all on a single ``iati-activity`` record. 

Hence, the minimum and maximum number of tests undertaken on an ``iati-activity`` or ``iati-organisation`` can fluctuate according to the content.

Non-Machine Readable Rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

IATI Org IDs\@ref
-------------------
* When reporting an IATI Org ID either for the publishers or another agency, it must be a valid organisation identifier.
* For the publisher, the identifier MUST be the same as that recorded by the publisher on the IATI Registry
iati-identifier
---------------
* It MUST be globally unique among all activities published through the IATI Registry
* Once an activity has been reported to IATI its identifier MUST NOT be changed in subsequent updates
* It MUST be prefixed with EITHER the organisation identifier found in ``reporting-org/@ref`` OR a previous ``reporting-org identifier`` reported in ``other-identifier``

recipient-country and recipient-region
--------------------------------------
* The recipient region must only be published in addition to the recipient country.

Machine Readable Rules

These rules are defined in a `JSON file <https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Rulesets/blob/version-2.02/rulesets/standard.json>` as part of our :doc:`Single Source of Truth </developer/ssot/>` that can be consumed programatically. The list below has been generated from that source.
